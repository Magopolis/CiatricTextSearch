    # CiatricTextApp 🚀  
## AI-Powered Transcript Search & Retrieval  

**CiatricTextApp** is a **local-first AI system** designed to **process, structure, and retrieve** insights from massive amounts of text data, including **transcripts, notes, and raw conversations**.

## 🔥 Why?  
Because **memory is a bottleneck**, and **AI forgets too fast**.  
This app fixes that by **tagging, indexing, and searching** thousands of pages like a **GitHub for thoughts**.
